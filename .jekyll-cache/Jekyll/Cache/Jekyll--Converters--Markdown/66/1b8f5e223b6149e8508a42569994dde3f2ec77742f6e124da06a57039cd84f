<p>Welcome to our first dishes digest! It’s a busy week, seems like we all have a lot on our  . . . plate. :)</p>

<h2 id="announcing-this-weeks-theme-washing-your-pan-thoroughly--">Announcing this weeks theme: washing your pan thoroughly 🧽🍳 🧽!!</h2>

<p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> did you know, that to wash a pan you should wash both the inside and the outside! Even if the outside seems clean. Not only that, but make sure to scrub the pan (like all other dishes) thoroughly with a sponge (often the green/rougher part of the sponge can help) and soap. Try to do this until the pan no longer feels grimy/oily or has any visible foodstuffs on it. That way we can prevent oil from building up and pans getting gross. Also – try to never use steel wool or any other metal (including spatulas) on non-stick pans – it’s dangerous as it can make the coating come off, ruining the non-stickness and releasing dangerous potentially carcinogens. What a fun fact!</p>

<p>I was out of town for the eclipse this past week, so I recruited an agent to take the picture for me (see if you can guess who 😲).  This picture is as of this past Friday – if any of the dishes are yours and still on the dishwasher, it would be really cool if you cleaned them if you had forgotten about them previously (and if you can make sure to label your dishes). Let’s keep our spaces spiffy!</p>
