<h2 id="announcing-this-weeks-theme-using-sponges---this-ones-juicy-">Announcing this weeks theme: Using Sponges ğŸ§½ ğŸ§½ (this oneâ€™s juicy!) !!</h2>

<p>Fun fact: did you know we have several different types of sponges? We have the yellow-green sponges (these are the default sponge), a scrubby brush, the rougher green rag/sponges, the blue swedish dish cloth, and steel wool. The back green side of the the yellow-green sponges are rougher. The blue swedish dish cloth is only for cleaning the stove/counter not for dishes!</p>

<p>In general, your order of trying to use sponges should be (you move on to the next if the previous wasnâ€™t enough to clean): yellow side of yellow-green sponge, green side of yellow-green sponge, scrubby brush, then steel wool. If you are needing to scrub too hard to get something off, you should use a rougher sponge to not damage it!</p>

<p>Biancaâ€™s Bold Bproposition: If you are washing a cutting board, you should use only the scrubby brush or harsher green sponges. The normal yellow-green sponges are damaged by the cutting boardâ€™s abrasive surface.</p>

<p>If you have a non-stick pan* you should only use the yellow/green dish cloth (anything metal or too rough can damage it and be dangerous). If you really need it on non-stick, you can try the rougher green sponge, but you need to be uber super-duper careful and gentle to not scratch it.</p>

<p>*To tell if you have a nonstick pan: nonstick pans tend to be the ones that donâ€™t look stainless (which you can usually tell from color and texture). If you arenâ€™t sure â€“ ask people if it is! Itâ€™s an intuition you can build up over time :) !</p>

<p>â€œThe dishwasher is still fullâ€ â€“ Kat</p>

<p>If any of the dishes pictured below are yours, itâ€™d be great if you could clean them!</p>

<p>This week was CPW, so we sure had some dishes on the dishwasher! However, I think the dishwasher hasnâ€™t been too bad/we recovered a bit after so thanks yâ€™all. Please remember to label your dishes â€“ which people have done a decent job at! Also, in general, avoid stacking dishes too high/precariously â€“ we donâ€™t want anything to tip and break.</p>
