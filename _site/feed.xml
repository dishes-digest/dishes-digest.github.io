<p>And what’s new, now were online too!! You can view a record of all dishes digests here, including this week’s here at <a href="https://dishes-digest.github.io">https://dishes-digest.github.io</a> ! Please check it out</p>

<h2 id="announcing-this-weeks-theme-using-sponges---this-ones-juicy-">Announcing this weeks theme: Using Sponges 🧽 🧽 (this one’s juicy!) !!</h2>

<p>Fun fact: did you know we have several different types of sponges? We have the yellow-green sponges (these are the default sponge), a scrubby brush, the rougher green rag/sponges, the blue swedish dish cloth, and steel wool. The back green side of the the yellow-green sponges are rougher. The blue swedish dish cloth is only for cleaning the stove/counter not for dishes!</p>

<p>In general, your order of trying to use sponges should be (you move on to the next if the previous wasn’t enough to clean): yellow side of yellow-green sponge, green side of yellow-green sponge, scrubby brush, then steel wool. If you are needing to scrub too hard to get something off, you should use a rougher sponge to not damage it!</p>

<p>Bianca’s Bold Bproposition: If you are washing a cutting board, you should use only the scrubby brush or harsher green sponges. The normal yellow-green sponges are damaged by the cutting board’s abrasive surface.</p>

<p>If you have a non-stick pan* you should only use the yellow/green dish cloth (anything metal or too rough can damage it and be dangerous). If you really need it on non-stick, you can try the rougher green sponge, but you need to be uber super-duper careful and gentle to not scratch it.</p>

<p>*To tell if you have a nonstick pan: nonstick pans tend to be the ones that don’t look stainless (which you can usually tell from color and texture). If you aren’t sure – ask people if it is! It’s an intuition you can build up over time :) !</p>

<h2 id="state-of-the-dishwasher">State of the Dishwasher</h2>

<p>“The dishwasher is still full” – Kat</p>

<p>If any of the dishes pictured below are yours, it’d be great if you could clean them!</p>

<p>This week was CPW, so we sure had some dishes on the dishwasher! However, I think the dishwasher hasn’t been too bad/we recovered a bit after so thanks y’all. Please remember to label your dishes – which people have done a decent job at! Also, in general, avoid stacking dishes too high/precariously – we don’t want anything to tip and break.</p>

It’s a busy week, seems like we all have a lot on our  . . . plate. :)</p>

<h2 id="announcing-this-weeks-theme-washing-your-pan-thoroughly-">Announcing this weeks theme: washing your pan thoroughly 🧽🍳🧽!!</h2>

<p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> did you know, that to wash a pan you should wash both the inside and the outside! Even if the outside seems clean. Not only that, but make sure to scrub the pan (like all other dishes) thoroughly with a sponge (often the green/rougher part of the sponge can help) and soap. Try to do this until the pan no longer feels grimy/oily or has any visible foodstuffs on it. That way we can prevent oil from building up and pans getting gross. Also – try to never use steel wool or any other metal (including spatulas) on non-stick pans – it’s dangerous as it can make the coating come off, ruining the non-stickness and releasing dangerous potentially carcinogens. What a fun fact!</p>

<h2 id="state-of-the-dishwasher">State of the Dishwasher</h2>

<p>I was out of town for the eclipse this past week, so I recruited an agent to take the picture for me (see if you can guess who 😲).  This picture is as of this past Friday – if any of the dishes are yours and still on the dishwasher, it would be really cool if you cleaned them if you had forgotten about them previously (and if you can make sure to label your dishes). Let’s keep our spaces spiffy!</p>
